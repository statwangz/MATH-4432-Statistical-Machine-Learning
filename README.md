## Course Information

[MATH 4432 Statistical Machine Learning](https://sites.google.com/site/eeyangc/teaching/math-4432-statistical-machine-learning)
 
Instructor: Prof. Can Yang

Teaching Assistant: Zhiwei Wang (<zhiwei.wang@connect.ust.hk>)

This course is open to senior undergraduates in applied mathematics, statistics, and engineering who are interested in learning from data.
It covers hot topics in statistical learning, also known as machine learning, featured with various applications.

## Tutorial Files

- T01, T02, T04, T05

The source files of the slides are `.Rmd` files.
If you are interested in how to create slides through R Markdown, you can have a look at them.

To get a full view of the slides, I recommend you open the `.html` files (e.g., [`Introduction.html`](https://github.com/statwangz/MATH-4432-Statistical-Machine-Learning/blob/main/T01%20A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20R/Introduction.html)) with your browser after downloading the entire repository.
Typically this works best in Chrome.

I also provide the PDF version via John Paul Helveston and Garrick Aden-Buie's R package [**renderthis**](https://github.com/jhelvy/renderthis).
```r
renderthis::to_pdf(from = "filename.Rmd", complex_slides = TRUE, partial_slides = FALSE)
```
**However, the ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù slides containing panelsets or other HTML widgets / advanced features might not render well as a PDF.**

- The others are `.ipynb` files.
